This repository contains all the code files that were employed in the user controlled catapult. The repository also contains the documentation detailing the project developed as well as the logic behind it's application.
The Project being described here is the Mini Hooper. It consists of a catapult capable of launching a ball up to 5 meters away. The distance the ball travels is dependent on the amount of torque the user wishes to use. This can be controlled via a knob placed near the catapult. An LCD display also shows the projected distance the ball will travel allowing the user to gauge the appropriate distance. The catapult is just one half of the Mini Hooper. The other half consists of a basketball hoop attached to a moving platform which can be controlled via bluetooth through an Android app using a smartphone. Once the ball has been launched by the catapult, the user can use his/her phone to control the hoop in order to catch the ball.
A link to a youtube video is also provided.
